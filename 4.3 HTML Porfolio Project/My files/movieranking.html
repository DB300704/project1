<h1>The Best Movies according to Dhanashree</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Maharaja</h3>
I loved it!Vijay Sethupathi shines in a realistic portrayal of Maharaja, while Anurag Kashyap surprises with a strong performance.<br/>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>"3 Idiots‚Äù is a compelling critique of the Indian educational system, wrapped in the garb of a buddy film. It is a masterpiece that entertains, enlightens, and leaves viewers with food for thought about their educational journeys.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed it.Interstellar optimistically and humanistically proposes that, even if the light is slowly dying in one place, a reasonable facsimile might be found as a substitute. </p>
